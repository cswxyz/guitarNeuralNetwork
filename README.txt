Welcome!

This project is a work in progress.

If you'd like to test out what I've got so far, follow these steps!

1. Run download_images.py
    - Downloaded images will be stored in data/raw_data

2. Run preprocessing.py
    - Preprocessed images will be stored in data/processed_data

3. Run train_model.py
    - Live data and results will be displayed in the terminal
    - The model will be stored as a .keras file in /models
